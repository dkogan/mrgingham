# Flags for python extension modules. See
# http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2017/11/14_python-extension-modules-without-setuptools-or-distutils.html
#
# I build the python extension module without any setuptools or anything.
# Instead I ask python about the build flags it likes, and build the DSO
# normally using those flags.
#
# There's some sillyness in Make I need to work around. First, I produce a
# python script to query the various build flags, but replacing all whitespace
# with __whitespace__. The string I get when running this script will then have
# a number of whitespace-separated tokens, each setting ONE variable
#
# I set up a number of variables:
#
#   These come from Python queries. I ask Python about XXX and store the result
#   into PY_XXX
#
#     PY_CC
#     PY_CFLAGS
#     PY_CCSHARED
#     PY_INCLUDEPY
#     PY_BLDSHARED
#     PY_LDFLAGS
#     PY_EXT_SUFFIX
#     PY_MULTIARCH
#
#  These process the above into a single set of CFLAGS:
#
#    PY_MRBUILD_CFLAGS
#
#  These process the above into a single set of LDFLAGS:
#
#    PY_MRBUILD_LDFLAGS
#
#  These process the above into a DSO-building linker command
#
#    PY_MRBUILD_LINKER
#
# When the user Makefile evaluates ANY of these variables I query python, and
# memoize the results. So the python is invoked at MOST one time. Any Makefiles
# that don't touch the PY_... variables will not end up invoking the python
# thing at all
