Section: libs
Architecture: any

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Chessboard finder for visual calibration routines
 Given an observed image containing a chessboard or a grid of circles, mrgingham
 locates the board in the image, and precisely computes the locatino of the
 chessboard corners (or circle centers). This is similar to the routines in
 OpenCV, but is faster and more robust.
 .
 This package provides the runtime C libraries
